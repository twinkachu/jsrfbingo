  <p>Jet Set Radio Future bingo is a game format in which players (or teams of players) race to collect a randomized 5x5 bingo board of in-game collectibles, including souls, character unlocks, and graffiti route completions. The game is played in a modified chapter 9 save file, in which all collectibles are available but none are unlocked. 
    <br><br>Each square is worth 1 point. Bonus points are awarded for graffiti route clears, and for claiming 5 squares in a row (bingo). A graffiti square is worth 3 points, and a bingo is worth 2 bonus points.
    <br><br>Soul squares can be marked as soon as you touch the soul, graffiti squares can be marked as soon as you finish the final tag, and character squares can be marked as soon as you get the “[character] has joined your team” text. You must mark your objectives as soon as you collect them - no witholding squares.
    <br><br>If you run out of health mid-game, you have to return to the place where you died before you can continue collecting squares. Players are not allowed to kill combo/return to title mid-game unless they are forfeiting.</p>
